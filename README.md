Code
The code for computing the estimators and reproducing the simulations and data analysis is available in the repository.
Shiny App
We also developed a Shiny app that is available at https://marielasued.shinyapps.io/shiny/, where the reader can experiment with different simulation scenarios. This app also allows you to run our procedure with a data set. In particular, it is possible to reproduce the data analyses included in the work.
